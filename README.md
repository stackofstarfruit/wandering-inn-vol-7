# wandering-inn-vol-7
Data visualization of The Wandering Inn made in R and Shiny

This repository is a data visualization of The Wandering Inn, a long serialized fantasy novel by pirateaba. 
The project is currently deployed using Shiny (https://stackofstarfruit.shinyapps.io/Wandering_Inn_7/). The
data was scraped directly from the website using the rvest package. The navbar is used to host visualizations
of different parts of the text (character appearance frequency, chapter word count, etc) while the sidebar 
controls more features relating to the display of the data.
